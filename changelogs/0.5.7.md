# 0.5.7

### FIXES

* Project-iOS/make now builds for armv7, armv7s, arm64, i386

### Breaking Changes

* removed support for (Google Toolkit for Mac)
   - still using some GTM categories for generating JUnit style XML reports
* removed support for MacOS < 10.7
* removed support for iOS < 5.1.1

### MacOS

* changed support from 10.6 to 10.7 - it has to happen at some point; why not now?
* removed support for 32 bit arch - there hasn't been one of these in a long time
* converted several NSInteger types to short to suppress compiler warnings iOS/MacOS e
* suppressed compiler warnings in `GHTesting.m` with an internal category
* removed duplicate method definition `receiveData:statusCode:MIMEType:afterDelay` from `GHMockURLConnection`
* enabled many, many, many warnings to get a handle on the state of the code
* updated the project to use modern objc syntax


### iOS

* updated the GHUnitIOSTestMain.m in the Tests target based on the swizzle approach
  - https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit/issues/96
* updated Scripts/RunTests.sh
  - now sets `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` based on:
    * http://goo.gl/ifXaqf
    * http://www.egeek.me/2012/10/03/jenkins-ghunit-launch-msg-error/
  - disabled all that funky trapping/launchctl stuff
    * i don't know what it is supposed to do
    * it did not work out of the box 
    * it never worked on Jenkins CI
* updated the Test target build settings to use ARC - how this was working before is a mystery, and not just to me.

    - thanks @bmelts, @bashery
* fixed Text target framework search path problem - was trying to import `iPhoneSimulator5.0.sdk framework`.     
* changed project deployment target to 5.1.1 - min to allow 64-bit slice 
* changed project Makefile to build static lib for all architectures
 
### Merges

* merged 113 added an environment variable for GHUnitIOS stderr redirection
  - thanks @JARinteractive
  - https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit/pull/113
  
* merged 119 updates documentation
  - thanks @gardner
  - https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit/pull/119
  
* manually merged Yelp/gh-unit pull 2 - fixes broken image compare tests
  - thanks @bashery
  - https://github.com/Yelp/gh-unit/pull/2
  
### Known Issues
  
* `GHUnitIOSTestViewTest/testNoSavedImage` - this test is failing on iOS < 7
* iOS 5,6,7 rotation might not be properly implemented
  - shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation is deprecated
* iOS 7 table is not pinned correctly to the bottom of the navigation bar
* iOS 7 search bar is missing
* iOS static lib building is in flux
  - Xcode project build settings + .xconfig files + Makefile = confusion

* would like a way to handle tests that are expected fail
  - compare exit codes?
  - use Calabash to automate iOS UI testing?
*  `GHImageDiffView.m` `scrollViewTextureBackgroundColor` is deprecated in iOS 7
* `dispatch_get_current_queue()` is deprecated iOS 6
  - i am not sure yet what it should be replaced with
  
### Candidates for Deprecation

* all the image compare code
  
### Testing

did not bother to check the iPad simulator retina vs. non-retina
